# CodeClauseInternship_ToDolist
Overview :
This is a simple To-Do List web application built as part of the Code Clause internship application. It allows users to manage their tasks in an interactive and stylish interface.
Features
* Add tasks by typing and pressing "Enter."
* Mark tasks as done by clicking on them.
* Remove tasks by clicking the delete icon.
* Displays a custom date in the header.
* Animated claps emoji party pop-up for completed tasks.
  
HTML Structure:
In the HTML part of the code, I've set up the basic structure of the web page. The title of the page is "To-Do List," and I've linked an external stylesheet to ensure a polished and visually appealing design. The heart of the application lies within the <div class="container"> element. Inside this container, I've placed a <div class="box"> that holds the key components of the To-Do List app.

Functionality:
The application's functionality is driven by JavaScript. First, I've implemented an event listener on the input box to capture tasks when the "Enter" key is pressed. This allows seamless task entry. When you click on a task, it toggles the "done" class, marking it as completed. Additionally, there's an "X" icon that lets you delete tasks when clicked.

Styling:
The visual appeal of the application is achieved through CSS styling. I've chosen a calming background gradient and utilized shadows and insets to create a three-dimensional effect. Each task is represented as a list item (<li>) with a stylish layout, making it easy on the eyes. The "done" tasks turn green, creating a clear differentiation between completed and pending tasks.

Dynamic Date Display:
One neat feature is the dynamic date display. Using JavaScript's Date object, I've created a custom date element that updates every minute. It showcases the current date in a user-friendly format, enhancing the overall user experience.

You can customize this web app to fit your preferences:
* Styles: Modify the style.css file to change colors, fonts, and other styles.
* Functionality: Adjust the JavaScript code in the index.html file to add new features or change existing ones.

This To-Do List web app isn't just a coding exercise; it's a practical example of how web development skills can be applied to everyday challenges. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've created a tool that not only helps manage tasks efficiently but also demonstrates my capabilities as a web developer.This project was created as part of the internship application for Code Clause. We hope you enjoy using it.
